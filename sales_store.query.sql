---Creating Database:
create database SalesStore;

---Creating Table:
create table sales_store(transaction_id varchar(10),
                         customer_id varchar(10),
						 customer_name varchar(30),
						 customer_age int,

---Importing Data:
copy sales_store(transaction_id,
                 customer_id,
				 customer_name,
				 customer_age,
				 gender,
				 product_id,
				 product_name,

from '‚Ä™C:\Users\MD DANISH KHAN\OneDrive\Desktop\sales.csv'
delimiter ','
csv header;

---Data Cleaning:
select * from sales_store;

create table sales_store_copy as
table sales_store;

select * from sales_store_copy;

---To check Duplicate Values:
select transaction_id,
       count(*)
from sales_store_copy
group by transaction_id
having count(*)>1;

with cte as(
select *,
       row_number()over(partition by transaction_id order by transaction_id) as row_num
from sales_store_copy)
select * from cte
where row_num>1;

---To Delete duplicate values of column transaction_id:
alter table sales_store_copy
add column serial_number serial;

delete from sales_store_copy
where serial_number in(93,38,4,232);

alter table sales_store_copy
drop column serial_number;


---Correction of headers:
select * from sales_store_copy;

alter table sales_store_copy 
rename column quantiy to quantity;

alter table sales_store_copy 
rename column prce to price;

---To Check Null values:
select * from sales_store_copy
where transaction_id is null
      or
	  customer_id is null

	  customer_name is null
	  or

---Treating null values:

---To Add Primary key:
alter table sales_store_copy
add constraint pk_transaction_id primary key(transaction_id);

---	To check description of table:
select * from information_schema.columns
where table_name='sales_store_copy';

---Data cleaning:
select distinct(gender) from sales_store_copy;

update sales_store_copy
set gender='Male'
where gender='M';

update sales_store_copy
set gender='Female'
where gender='F';
